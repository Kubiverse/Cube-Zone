> Cube.Zone is a social cubing platform where cubers can race and interact with each other in real time. This is the source code of the Cube.Zone front end web application, distributed under the MIT License. The current production version of the application can be viewed at https://cube.zone.

> The Cube.Zone frontend uses the proprietary Kubeverse backend graphql API and the Pusher web socket service for transmitting live data. Example credentials and endpoints are available in this package for contributors to use.
